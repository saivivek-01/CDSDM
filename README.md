# CDSDM â€” Centralized Database for Student Details Management

## Overview

CDSDM is a PHP-based web application designed to simplify and centralize student data management for educational institutions. The project emphasizes **cloud-native deployment**, **vendor-agnostic infrastructure**, and **data security** by leveraging **external managed databases** and modern cloud technologies.

## Key Features and Standout Deployment Highlights

### 1. Vendor Lock-In Resistant Architecture
- **Decoupled Database Layer:** CDSDM connects to an externally managed database service (e.g., Railway, Azure Database, or any cloud-managed DB) instead of bundling the database within the same cloud environment.
- **Data Portability & Security:** Student data is maintained independently of the application hosting environment. This design ensures that data remains secure and accessible even if the application is migrated across cloud providers or moved on-premises.
- **Seamless Cloud Migration:** The architecture supports easy re-hosting of the application across multiple CSPs (Cloud Service Providers) using containerization and Infrastructure as Code (IaC), without disrupting data access or risking data loss.

### 2. Cloud-Native Deployment Using Docker & Infrastructure as Code
- **Containerized Application:** The entire CDSDM application runs inside Docker containers, ensuring consistent runtime environments and easy scaling.
- **Multi-Cloud Ready:** Demonstrated deployments on Azure (primary), with the ability to deploy on AWS, GCP, or DigitalOcean by updating IaC scripts.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform scripts provision and manage cloud resources declaratively, automating environment setup, enhancing reproducibility, and enabling version-controlled infrastructure changes.

### 3. Secure, Scalable, and Highly Available
- **HTTPS with Automated SSL:** Integrated with Certbot and Nginx reverse proxy to enable HTTPS, ensuring secure data in transit.
- **Firewall and Network Security:** Configured firewalls and Docker networks isolate the app and database access, reducing the attack surface.
- **Scalable Deployment:** Container orchestration compatibility (Docker Compose, Kubernetes) planned for future scaling based on institutional needs.

### 4. Modular and Maintainable Codebase
- Clean separation of concerns in PHP code, enabling quick feature enhancements and bug fixes.
- Externalized sensitive configuration (database credentials, hostnames) managed securely via environment variables.
